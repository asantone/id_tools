## docx_stitch
`Python`

The purpose of this tool is to combine the content of multiple `.docx` files into a single merged file. A possible use case would be to combine a linearly-arranged series of notes or scripts into a single document for easier searching and text manipulation.

This tool extracts the presenter notes from multiple `.pptx` files and exports the content of each file to separate `.docx` files.

## pptx_ost_export
`Python`

This tool extracts the on-screen text (OST) from multiple `.pptx` files and exports the content of each file to separate `.docx` files. A possible use case would be to extract text content from a slide deck so it can be loaded into a teleprompter or manipulated in some other way.
